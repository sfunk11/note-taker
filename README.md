  ## Usage
  The application starts on the main page. Clicking "Get Started" will move you to the notes page.  You can add notes by entering a title and typing in the text area.  When ready, click the save icon to save your note.  This will cause the note to clear off the main part of the page and be added to the list on the left. You can click on the delete button associated with each note when you no longer need it and are ready to remove it from the page.
